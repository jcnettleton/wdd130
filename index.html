    <p>Welcome to my WDD 130 portfolio. I am a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying Web Design and Development. I am currently in my second semester of the program and am excited to learn more about web development. I am from the beautiful state of Idaho and love the outdoors. I enjoy hiking, camping, and rafting. I am excited to learn more about web development and how I can use it to help others.</p>
